This is the documentation for the AEGIS (Academic Exam Generator for Interchange and Shuffe) package.

The purpose is to compose a collection of exams from a set of several versions
of a number of problems.  This is useful to generate several examns with a
similar dificulty.  It also can be used to generate alternative exams from a
pool of exercises.

It requires a system with Latex and a pool of exercises written on separated
Latex files.
